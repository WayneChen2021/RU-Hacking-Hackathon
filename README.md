Predicting Stock Price Movements from Financial Statements (using Transformers)

Steps:
1. Download and unzip SEC financial statement data from [here](https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html)
2. Run ```stock_price_data.py```. Make sure to apply the changes specified in the file (they are left as comments). You may also have to pip install some libraries.
3. Run ```stock_price_model.py```. Make sure your system has CUDA (if not, I suggest running the code on Google Colab). Make sure to apply the changes specified in the file (they are left as comments). You may also have to pip install some libraries.
